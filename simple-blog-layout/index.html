      <h1>Dunning-Kruger effect</h1>

      <p>
        The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with limited competence in a particular domain
        overestimate their abilities. It was first described by Justin Kruger and David Dunning in 1999. Some
        researchers also include the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills.
        In popular culture, the Dunning-Kruger effect is often misunderstood as a claim about general overconfidence of
        people with low intelligence instead of specific overconfidence of people unskilled at a particular task.

      <h1>Cognitive Bias</h1>
      <p>
        A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals
        create their own "subjective reality" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of
        reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behavior in the world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes
        lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, and irrationality.

      <p>
        While cognitive biases may initially appear to be negative, some are adaptive. They may lead to more effective
        actions in a given context. Furthermore, allowing cognitive biases enables faster decisions which can be
        desirable when timeliness is more valuable than accuracy, as illustrated in heuristics. Other cognitive
        biases are a "by-product" of human processing limitations, resulting from a lack of appropriate mental
        mechanisms (bounded rationality), the impact of an individual's constitution and biological state (see embodied
        cognition), or simply from a limited capacity for information processing. Research suggests that cognitive
        biases can make individuals more inclined to endorsing pseudoscientific beliefs by requiring less evidence for
        claims that confirm their preconceptions. This can potentially distort their perceptions and lead to inaccurate
        judgments.
